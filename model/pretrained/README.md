# Pretrained model directory

Save a pretrained model to this directory for use in neural-style transfer.

By default, `nst_vgg19.py` will look for `imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat` in this directory. 

`imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat` can be downloaded from the [MatConvNet website](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/ 'Pretrained models').
